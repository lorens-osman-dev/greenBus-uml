Call it a blog, or a very long text document in your repo, whatever but pour out your current frame of mind AT THE TIME YOU HAD THE THOUGHTS.

Saved my butt more than once because if you work at any decent speed, you have to empty your dome to make room for the next mini universe that is about to move in. Once you get in that habit and do it well, it is amazingly freeing. Immediate payback.

Even better is when you hop from DB to DB, from Postgres relational to MySQL relational to neo4j graph db.. you gotta have notes or invest the time to recreate the "universe" you haven't thought about for over a year. Delayed payback.
